# GCSE Geography #1 - UK Rock Types

## Rock types

There are three main types of rock found in the UK:

- Sedimentary rock
- Metamorphic rock
- Igneous rock

## Sedimentary rocks

Sedimentary rocks are made up of **layers**, known as **beds**.

Because they have been compacted together over a long time, they often contain **fossils**.

### Examples of sedimentary rocks

There are two main examples of sedimentary rock you need to know:

- Chalk
- Sandstone

### Chalk

Chalk is a type of sedimentary rock made of **calcium carbonate**.

Because of this, it is very affected by **chemical weathering** (erodes easily in *acid rain*).

### Sandstone

Sandstone is a type of sedimentary rock and is formed when **sand-sized particles are cemented together**.

It is very **resistant to weathering**. However, it is **permeable** (lets water through).

## Metamorphic rocks

Metamorphic rocks are formed when other rock types are put under **immense heat and pressure**.

They are often very **hard** and **not easily eroded**.

### Examples of metamorphic rocks

There are two main examples of metamorphic rock:

- Slate
- Schist

### Slate

Slate is formed at **destructive plate boundaries** from **mudstone**.

It is very **hard** and **resistant** to erosion. However, it can easily be **split into layers**.

### Schist

Schist is also formed at **destructive plate boundaries**, but is formed at a much **higher pressure**.

Like slate, it is **hard** and **resistant**.

## Igneous rocks

Igneous rocks are **hard** and **resistant**. They are formed from **crystals** and are resistant to erosion.

Typically, igneous rocks are **impermeable**.

### Examples of igneous rocks

The two main examples of igneous rocks are:

- Granite
- Basalt

### Granite

Granite is an igneous rock that is susceptible to chemical weathering.

It is mostly hard and resistant, and is impermeable.

This means that land above granite drains badly and so often forms bogs.

### Basalt

Basalt is formed when lava flow cools.

It is hard and resistant.

## Summary

| Name of rock | Type of rock | Formation                                      | Properties      | Easily Weathered?                        | Permeable? |
| ------------ | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Chalk        | Sedimentary  | Made of calcium carbonate                      | Soft            | Yes - susceptible to chemical weathering | No         |
| Sandstone    | Sedimentary  | Sand-sized particles cement together           | Medium-strength | No                                       | Yes        |
| Slate        | Metamorphic  | Formed at destructive margins from mudstone    | Hard            | Yes                                      | No         |
| Schist       | Metamorphic  | Formed at destructive margins - high pressures | Hard            | Yes                                      |            |
