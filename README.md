## Licence

For the most part, you can use this repo however you wish for personal
projects. Please do not, however, fork this repo as an 'alternate'
version, as this will simply lead to confusion and a lack of development!

## Contributing

We'd really appreciate it if you could contribute to this repo!  
The easiest way to do this is by
[creating an issue](https://github.com/AtomicNotes/learn/issues) to report
a missing or incorrect lesson.  
If you have the time, it would be extremely helpful to
[create a pull request](https://github.com/AtomicNotes/learn/pulls) and
add the lesson yourself!

Thanks for the support <3
